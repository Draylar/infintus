# Infintus

Avarit... uh, I mean, Infintus!

Infintus is a far-endgame mod focused on adding insanely overpowered items and gear that come at ridiculous costs. 

Singularities can be crafted out of materials-- for example, an Iron Singularity costs 10,000 iron ingots by default. You'll need a number of every singularity to make an Ultimate Singularity, which can be used to make Ultimate Items. You'll need a couple thousand Ultimate Items to make an Infinity Singularity, which can be used to make insanely strong gear.
